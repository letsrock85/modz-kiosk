We’re finalizing the setup for the two interactive kiosks in the MODZ booth and need your help creating a smooth experience for people to use.

We've opted to buy 2 Raspberry Pi's to run them instead of using the "ELO" software that came with the kiosk.

I was thinking we could use either FullPageOS, or Pi Kiosk to run the experience but of course you could use whatever you think is best.

We just need the touch screen to boot up to a page we make that has four options for our team or people to tap on. (see example below)

(Art is not final. We can make you the final image once we know what we need)
Once someone taps a button, it should open one of the four PDFs we’ll give you. Inside the PDFs, we want users to flip through them the way you can with tools like FlipHTML5 or FlowPaper.

For the PDF viewer, we’ll need a few things:

A Home button that takes you back to the main kiosk screen

A Back button that returns you to that PDF’s table of contents

Working table of contents links in each PDF so if someone taps a section like wheels it jumps straight to that part

And one more thing. If the kiosk sits untouched, it should reset back to the main screen with the four buttons. Ten minutes of inactivity should do the trick.

One final thing to mention is we will not have wifi at the booth so we can't just load up  a webpage

Let me know if you have any questions about any of my ideas here.
